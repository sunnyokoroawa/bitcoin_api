A Bitcoin Restful API 

This is a Restful API built on ASP.NET Core.

This is for educational purpose, it assumes you are running your own node.

For this project, I am running a signet network on a bitcoin core v22 on a windows 10 box with Ubutu installed on it. 

This souldn't have been a success without the guide and mentorship of the following friends on Twitter
